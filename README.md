## Reading List

1. The logic portion of the reading list requires serious reworking. None of the essays except Kripke's Semantical Considerations in Modal Logic are about logic, and that's a relatively technical paper requiring a background in modal logic to understand! The Tarski and Lewis papers are epistemology and metaphysics, respectively. The same criticism applies to the sole book recommended by this illustrious collection of gamers. There's no introductory books on modal logic, intuitionistic logic, multivalued and fuzzy logics, set theory, model theory, computability theory or proof theory relevant to anyone referencing a Word document they found on Discord to learn about logic. I'm hesitant to make recommendations, in part because most introductory books on logic are terrible.
Some recommendations:

* Priest, An Introduction to Non-classical Logic. Introduces propositional and first-order classical, intuitionistic, multivalued, and modal logics using tableaux with a lot of sensitivity to philosophical issues.
* van Dalen, Logic and Structure. Intermediate level introduction to first-order classical and intuitionistic logic.
* Blackburn et al., Modal Logic. Introduction to modal logic with emphasis on applications in computer science. Covers some advanced topics like topological semantics in an accessible way.
* Enderton, Elements of Set Theory, A Introduction to Mathematical Logic, Computability Theory. In descending order of goodness. Very accessible to undergraduates because they don't assume a great deal of mathematical sophistication.
* Cutland, Computability Theory. A very dated but accessible introduction to computability theory. I like it, but it's incomplete and despite covering very little ground a little terse.
* Sipser, An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata. Standard text in computer science for courses on theory of computation. (edited)
These recommendations are aimed at an undergraduates in philosophy or computer science.
* Urzyczyn and Sørensen, Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism. Introduction to lambda calculus and type theory. 
* Hindley and Seldin, Lambda Calculus and Combinators. A very accessible introduction to lambda calculus and combinatory calculi. It covers some of the same ground as the preceding book but with incredible detail, precision and clarity. 
I can't think of a single accessible introduction to model theory, but
* Button and Walsh, Philosophy and Model Theory
is very well written and introduces all the core concepts with extensive discussions of their applications to philosophy.
My list is pretty biased and contains some big gaps, but I'm trying to avoid both "big" and "hard" books.
Nope  I like the Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Readings (ed. Benacerraf & Putnam) anthology, though - it has lots of historically important papers that IIRC are missing from the Blackwell anthology.

5. Logic the basics:

6. Garrett Brian – Elementary Logic

7. What do you think of this book as a suggestion for the list? It looks like it hits nearly all the major mathematical logic topics on the list in a single volume.
